# Identifying_Car_Sides

In this project I have built a model that can successfully identify the car sides.
In the above files you'll find all the data, model and a jupyter notebook containing the steps followed to successfully complete this project.

## Libraries used
to complete this project there are some libraries that must be installed. Those libraries are: numpy, os, PIL, tensorflow, cv2, sklearn, matplotlib, imgaug, skimage, IPython, tensorflow_datasets.

## Project Motivation
This idea was a part of my unversity training and I was intrigued by it so, I applied it and finished it.
Such project can be ustilized at any checkpoint on boarders between countries or at toll centers when entering a highway or any other applications where cars need to be identified.

## Files in Repository
**1- Capstone_Project.ipynb and Capsatone_Project.html: contain the full code of this project including building and ttraining the model, data processing, and webcam testing.**

**2- Data folder: contain the data after applying augmentation to it.**

**3- Data_no_aug folder: contain the data before applying augmentation to it.**

**4- CV_model.h5: contains the weights of the saved best model.**

**5- Results folder: contains the results of the webcam testing.**

## Summary
In this project it was noted that the use of data augmentation helped us in reducing overfitting and in increasing the size of data when it was small.

also we have successfully built a model that can identify car sides.


# Important Note:
**Data folder, Data_no_aug folder, and CV_model.h5 were uploaded to google drive because they are too big in size to be uploaded to Github.
